      <h2>Helix</h2>
      <p>
        <br>
        Helix is a CPU rendering software I started briefly in summer, and since late September 2025, have
        dedicated a lot more time to. There were several reasons as to why I wanted to take on this
        project, I was originally inspired by Sebastian Lague's "Coding Adventure" series, especially
        his raytracer and fluid solver projects.
        <br><br>

      <p>
        This project also opened up a variety learning opportunities and new challenges for me. At the time,
        I had recently gotten a new laptop, and setup Arch Linux for the first time. As well as this, I also started
        using Neovim, a text editor with a lot of keyboard-centric flexibility and a steep learning curve. This
        project gave me the perfect excuse to sink hours into learning, as well as getting comfortable with all of
        these new concepts.
      </p>
      <p>
        <br>
        Now one of the first questions I get when I talk about my render engine is 'Why call it "Helix?"'.
        Whenever I imagine the word helix, the first thing that comes to mind is DNA, or a "double helix".
        This project was my first time using C++, I wanted to challenge myself, and had the drive to create
        this project, so having to learn a new programming language wasn't going to stop me. One of the first
        questions I had when first learning C++ was, "What's a double?", turns out it's a float with double the
        precision, and that's where the idea first came from to call it Helix, and it's stuck ever since.

        Below is my latest renders, as well as the journey that got me here.
