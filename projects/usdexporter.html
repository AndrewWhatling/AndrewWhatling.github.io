        This point deform procedural was inspired by a blog post by Marcel Ruegenberg and was designed for my 
        final year university film. In his post "Hacking Houdini Solaris Procedurals" he goes into explaining 
        what procedurals are, and the theory behind how they are made.<br><br>

        Houdini procedurals are compiled scene graphs that can be ran at render time to manipulate, create or 
        destroy geometry during the render itself. The advantage of something like this, and the main purpose 
        of this procedural in particular, is saving disk space. The standard pipeline for point deformed animation
        is to take the mesh and deform it by curves, and save each frame of that out to disk, the issue with that 
        is that for every frame of animation, you are saving out the full geometry again and again. As an example,
        if you are working with a forest, you could be looking at hundreds of gigabytes per frame. The point deform
        procedural is a wrapper for the sop level point deform node, taking a static meshs, static curves and
        animated curves, and deforming the mesh by the curves at render time, and eliminates the need to save
        any deformed geometry to disk.<br><br>

       The first step in creating the point deform procedural was to setup the node graph that I will then be converting
       into the procedural. The first thought that I had was to just use the point deform node itself, which I think might 
       work as of the current version of houdini, however as you can see here I ended up not using that.<br><br>

       Instead what I decided was to strip down the point deform node into only the elements that I needed from it to 
       capture and deform the geometry. The reason for this is because I found that using relative and channel references 
       inside of a procedural doesn't work. This is (I believe) because at render time, nodes don't actually exist. So 
       when you are referencing nodes from within that compiled graph, Husk doesn't know where to grab the value from and 
       ends up not working.
