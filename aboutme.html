      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        <br>
        Hey there! I'm Andrew. I am currently in my final year of studying Visual Effects at the University
        of Hertfordshire, and I aspire to work in R&amp;D within the Visual Effects industry.
        My key area of interest is in the development of Proprietary software, especially when it
        comes to Rendering. Alongside this I love creating new tools and solutions to solve problems
        artists are experiencing. The work I do enables artists to do what they do best, while minimising
        the friction they experience with the tools and software they work with on a daily basis.

        My main DCC of choice is Houdini, and I'm familiar with Nuke and Maya. I'm most confident in
        Python and VEX, and I'm currently learning C++. I have experience in offline rendering development,
        DCC tool development, HDA Development, and performance optimization. I really enjoy diving straight
        into the puzzles that this industry presents, and I love the mixture of creativity and technical
        innovation that Visual Effects is so well known for.
      </p>
      <p>
        <br>
        Outside of work, I enjoy listening to music, trying out silly coding ideas, going to the gym,
        researching new things, ricing linux, and hanging out with my friends/colleagues.
