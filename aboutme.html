      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <br>
      <p>
        Hey there! I'm Andrew, and I aspire to work in R&amp;D within the Visual Effects industry.
        My key area of interest is in the development of Proprietary software, especially when it
        comes to Rendering. Alongside this I love creating new tools and solutions to solve problems
        artists are experiencing, and to enhance their, and my own, workflows. The work I do enables
        artists to do what they do best, while minimising the friction they experience with the tools and
        software they work with on a daily basis.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        I have experience in offline rendering development, DCC tool development, HDA Development,
        and performance optimization. I really enjoy diving straight into the puzzles that this
        industry presents, and I love the mixture of creativity and technical innovation that
        Visual Effects is so well known for.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        Outside of work, I enjoy listening to music, trying out silly coding ideas, playing games,
        researching new things, and hanging out with my friends/colleagues.
